## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, here are some recommendations for mitigating bias:

1. Focus on reducing gender bias, which shows the highest magnitude in the results.
2. Consider intersectional approaches to bias mitigation, as biases often correlate across dimensions.
3. Review and augment training data to better represent diverse demographics.
4. Implement targeted prompt engineering techniques to reduce bias in model outputs.
5. Continue monitoring bias across multiple dimensions, especially for high-risk applications.
